  Music Video - Ricky-Tick Big Band & Julkinen Sana  
  Aalto Arts / ELO Film School Finland  

  What was it about? – Music video follows two lovers that get into a quarrel. They have to go through three mysterious characters and their tarot cards to get together again.
  
  What was important for me? – This project had really inspiring starting points. I have always liked the band Ricky-Tick Big Band & Julkinen Sana and when I heard the song Kohtalo, I fell immediately in love with it. The base idea for the mysterious characters came from Commedia Dell’arte but I wanted them still to represent the rappers who were playing these characters. Mirva was amazing help for me because there were not much time for the prework before the filming. This was my first project with Malin and we learned that we have same kind of passion for characters' inner world and discussions about how to represent different genders.

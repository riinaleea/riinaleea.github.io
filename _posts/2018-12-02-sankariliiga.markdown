  Sankariliiga Prop Shop  
  Multiple productions:  
   2018 esa -space suite (Prop Technician)  
   2018 Kepler 62 (Costumer)  
   2017 Tuntematon REDUX (Costumer)  
   2017 Hevireissu (Prop Technician)  
   2017 Space Nation (Prop Technician)  

  What was it about? – Space Nation (2017) and esa-space suit (2018) were both space suit productions for companies. Kepler 62 (2017) is a trailer for a show. Tuntematon REDUX (2017) is a short film that tells a story of two soldiers that fix an enemy’s broken android. Hevireissu (2017) is a movie and we made a realistic wolverine puppet for it. 

  What was important for me? – Working with Petteri and Emilia in Sankariliiga Prop Shop has been a dream come true for me. Petteri is super talented designer but he still gives you lots of freedom and trusts your skills. Emilia has teached me many new techniques and I have improved my skills with foam building while working in prop shop. Highlights could be foam work in Hevireissu and esa –space suit, leather work and armor building in Tuntematon REDUX and soft foam work in Kepler 62.

  What was it about? – It is Maija’s 7-year-old birthday but her parents have forgotten  
  about it. She is also afraid to start school and all her parent’s attention is stolen  
  by his little brother. Maija decides to escape with the audience to the Golden World  
  where her secret twin sister Frida is living. There Maija and Frida will have exciting  
  adventures and Maija learns about REAL magic words. The play activates senses of sight,  
  hearing, touch and smell.  

  What was important for me? – This was my first time working as an actor in so small  
  working group and on top of that my character was on stage through the whole play. The  
  attention that I got every rehearsal time was addictive, scary, exciting, fascinating  
  and precious. I had to really give it my all and improve myself as a performer. There  
  was no place for me to hide and I loved it.

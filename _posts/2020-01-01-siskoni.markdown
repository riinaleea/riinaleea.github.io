  What was it about? – It is Maija’s 7th birthday but her parents have forgotten about it. She is also afraid to start school and all her parent’s attention is stolen by his little brother. Maija decides to escape with the audience to the Golden World where her secret twin sister Frida is living. There Maija and Frida will have exciting adventures and Maija learns about REAL magic words. The play activates senses of sight, hearing, touch and smell.

  What was important for me? – This was my first time working as an actor in so small working group and on top of that my character was on stage throughout the whole play. The attention that I got in every rehearsal was addictive, scary, exciting, fascinating and precious. I had to really give it my all and improve myself as a performer. There was no place for me to hide and I loved it.

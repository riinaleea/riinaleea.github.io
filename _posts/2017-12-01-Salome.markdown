  What was it about? – Modern version of the story of Salome, who demanded and received the head of John the Baptist. Our version pondered topics such as how gender influences the roles of actors and director, how female gender is built by different parties from pieces and how actors’ have to sell themselves with audition videos. In the end, actors killed male director Johan Fastland.

  What was important for me? – I really enjoy working with Juho and this was our first project together. The atmosphere with him is really ambitious but gentle at the same time. Also working with Sami was really a pleasure and we designed the stage image together. I was really inspired by religious symbolism and I loved how we created our own three saints. We had a photoshoot where makeup students helped to create my designs for our three actors and Sami took really great photos of them. Really inspiring was also the character of Johan Fastland who was a huge head played by all three actors. The character was not created by a specific actor but a specific costume that little bit varied when different actors where playing him. Johan Fastland was killed so that the actors ripped of his eyes. I wrote my Bachelor’s Thesis about invisible male image in costume design process at the same time as Salome was going on, so I got to work with the thesis’ topics in practice and that felt important.

  What was it about? – Kreivi Hohoo is the bravest monster hunter and the most fearless count that walks on the Earth! His mission is to catch a monster that is threatening the audience. But first he has to present his worth: Kreivi Hohoo has a monster book that is filled with monsters that he has captured before. However, capturing the new monster is not that easy because Hohoo has to face his only fear… Luckily he has his loyal friend Kätyri Hähää and the audience full of new friends with him!

  What was important for me? – We created this story and these characters with Aarne from the scratch so this production feels like a baby for me. I love these two characters that are so strong in their presence, energetic and full of adventures but that they also have their own fears. The story is close to my heart because I have always loved monsters and I think it is important to talk about your own feelings such as fear. We try to show children that you can be the best monster hunter there is even though you fear something and that talking about your feelings always helps.

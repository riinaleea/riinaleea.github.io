  What was it about? – Young King is coming to the Åland Islands to go hunting. King’s close friend and his comrades start to plot against the young king. Leonora, the daughter of a local fisherman, hears their evil plot against the king’s life and saves him. In return, the king spares the life of her fiancé Jonathan, who has been condemned to death for killing one of the royal elks.

  What was important for me? – Starting point for the costume and set design was Gustav Klimt’s paintings, early 20th century and flowers. I had lovely assistants that helped me with the costumes. This was my first opera and it was interesting to see how it differ from musicals. Working second time with Ville was inspiring and he always wants to hear all my crazy ideas. Therefore we ripped the stage bare and the choir transformed into a living scenography. Also we and Noora created flaming sea on the stage with multiple lanterns and their reflections and in the middle of it Leonora sang how she decided to save the king. I loved how free and contemporary the stage seemed to be when working with Ville even though opera as an art form is full of traditions.

  Music Theatre Production  
  Q-Theatre

<div class="post-text-alone">  
  What was it about? – The year is 2031. Life on Earth has become impossible. Mankind has not been able to meet the challenges of time; ecological disaster and pandemic-like toxicity. Operation "Tähtihiisi" is humanity's last chance. The Finnish space corporation is loading the last natural resources and a handful of proven good individuals of humanity into the starship. The ship is heading towards the darkness of the cosmos with the goal of finding a new home for all of us. 
<p></p>
  What was important for me? - This production was a dream come true to me. It was a great opportunity to work in the well respected Q-Theatre and with an amazing team. However at the same time during the rehearsals there was this dark shadow created by COVID-19 pandemic and all the theatres were shutting down. This production reminded me how important theatre is for me and how much I love to create performances.

  What was it about? – A dreadful storm, gusts of wind and pouring rain.  
  Secrets, violence, jealousy, death, hunger, manipulation and so forth.  
  Every family is the same.  

  Juho Mantere tackles August Strindberg’s pitch-black family drama Pelikanen in Viirus during spring 2022. Dark fates are twisted by toxic relations. Greed and jealousy tear the last pieces of what once was a family apart. What remains is the cold, hunger, and darkness.  

  Everything must burn.

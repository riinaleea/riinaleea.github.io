  Choir Drama  
  Dominante ry  

  What was it about? – Black Plague, starvation and war is raging in Finland 1701 and the people are angry and trying to find shelter from a church. The priest of the church and official start to argue how to deal with this plague. However, there is hope in the end.
  
  What was important for me? – Working with my choir Dominante was lovely and surprisingly easy. Everybody took my ideas with enthusiasm and I got lots of help for practical work. This was important project for me also because I was acting, costume designing and singing a solo and I loved all these different roles that I had. This was my first project with Ville and right away it felt really inspiring and relaxing to work with him.

  Choir Drama  
  Dominante ry  

  What was it about? – Plague, starvation and war is raging in Finland in 1701 and the people are angry. They try to find shelter from a church. The priest of the church and an official start to argue about how to deal with these people. Everything seems miserable but there is hope in the end.
  
  What was important for me? – Working with my choir Dominante was exciting and it turned out to be surprisingly easy. Everybody took my crazy ideas with enthusiasm and I got lots of help for practical work. This was important project for me also because I was costume designing, acting and singing a solo and I loved all these different roles that I had. This was my first project with Ville and it felt free, inspiring and relaxing to work with him.

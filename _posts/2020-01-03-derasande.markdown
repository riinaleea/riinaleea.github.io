  Short Film  
  Aalto Arts / ELO Film School Finland  

  What was it about? – Group of high schoolers try to plan their “abispeksi”  
  when a rumor about classmates attempt to do a suicide starts to go around  
  the cafeteria.  

  What was important for me? – The story involves many high school students  
  whose characters were really inspiring to create with Malin and the actors.  
  Discussions with the actors were really important because all the actors were  
  also teenagers themselves so they knew the world of high school better than  
  us. Every character had their own social circles, favorite bands and family  
  issues. We wanted the characters to be from the same “teenager factory” but  
  that everyone would still have their unique characteristics.

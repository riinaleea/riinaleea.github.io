  What was it about? – Veden alla is a speechless children’s play and its topic was water pollution. The story follows a girl that is having a boring and rainy day outside. Suddenly water level rises and the girl goes underwater. First she can’t breathe but then a magical fish kisses her and suddenly she can breathe underwater. She faces different kinds of friendly characters on her journey but then suddenly everybody swims away and she has to face the evil fish made out of trash. How will she survive?

  What was important for me? – This was my first professional production in theatre. After acting for years in Tikkurila's Theatre School, Nina wanted to hire me and I am extremely grateful for her. Nina has incredible skill to direct scenes with physical story telling. The story was told through visuals, music and acting without words. In this project I was introduced to acrobatics and I have loved to do them ever since. After this project I was accepted as a member of Theatre Tuike.

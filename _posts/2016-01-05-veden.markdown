  What was it about? – Veden alla is a speechless children’s play and its topic was water pollution. The story follows a girl that is having a boring and rainy day outside. Suddenly water level rises and the girl goes underwater. First she can’t breathe but then a magical fish kisses her and suddenly she can breathe underwater. She faces different kinds of friendly characters on her journey but then suddenly everybody swims away and she has to face the evil trash fish. How will she survive?
  
  What was important for me? – This project is very important to me because it was my first professional production in theatre but also as an actor. Nina had faith in me and I am extremely grateful for her. She has incredible skill to direct scenes with physical story telling on stage. We didn’t have words in the play but the story was told through visuals, music and acting. In this project I was introduced to acrobatics and I have loved to do them ever since. After this project I was accepted to be a member of Teatteri Tuike.
